1. When using INSERT, is the list of columns necessary? Why or why not?
	* Specifying the target column names right after the table name is optional, but by doing so, you
control the value-column associations instead of relying on the order of the columns in the CREATE
TABLE statement. In T-SQL, specifying the INTO clause is optional.
2. When using INSERT SELECT, do you use a subquery (derived table)? Under what circumstances do
you not use a subquery?
	* you can use a subquery, you have to use a subquery for INSERT SELECT?
3. What is the operand for the INSERT EXEC statement?
	* The operand is a procedure.
	* You use the INSERT EXEC statement to insert a result set returned from a stored procedure or a
dynamic SQL batch into a target table. 
4. How would you use the INSERT INTO statement?
	* In terms of
syntax, simply add INTO <target_table_name> right before the FROM clause of the SELECT query you
want to use to produce the result set.
5. What are the parameters to the BULK INSERT statement?
	*  You can specify many options,
including the data file type (for example, char or native), the field terminator, the row terminator, and
othersâ€”all of which are fully documented. 
6. Does IDENTITY guarantee uniqueness? If not, how do you guarantee uniqueness?
	* no, define a primary key or a unique constraint on that column.
7. How do you create a SEQUENCE object?
	* use the CREATE SEQUENCE command
8. How do you use a SEQUENCE object?
	* With sequences, you can
store the result of the function in a variable and use it later in the code
9. How do you alter a SEQUENCE object?
	* use update statement
10. What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?
	* The standard TRUNCATE statement deletes all rows from a table. Unlike the DELETE statement,
TRUNCATE has no filter.
	* delete operates row by row, turncate operates by table.
11. What is the difference between DELETE and DROP TABLE?
	* DELETE is a Data Manipulation Language command, DML command and is used to remove tuples/records from a relation/table. Whereas DROP is a Data Definition Language, DDL command and is used to remove named elements of schema like relations/table, constraints or entire schema.
